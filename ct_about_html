<h2>About us
  <br />
  <p>
  Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
  North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
  years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
  that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
  with our modern mobile food truck.</p>
  
  <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
  paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
  mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
  11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
  11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
  difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
 <strong> Curbside Thai </strong> will deliver.</p>
  
 <p> Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
  what <cite>Carolina Traveler </cite>calls the<q> finest Asian food 
  on or off the streets of Charlotte.</q></p>
